======================================

.. py:module:: mleko.dataset.feature_select

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   The subpackage provides functionality for selecting features from data.

   This subpackage offers a collection of feature selectors, each designed for a specific type of feature selection
   task. By using these unique feature selectors sequentially, you can create a complete feature selection workflow
   within the pipeline.

   The following feature selectors are provided by the subpackage:
       - `BaseFeatureSelector`: The abstract base class for all feature selectors.
       - `CompositeFeatureSelector`: A feature selector for combining multiple feature selectors.
       - `MissingRateFeatureSelector`: A feature selector for removing features with a high percentage of missing values.
       - `VarianceFeatureSelector`: A feature selector for removing features with a low standard deviation.
       - `PearsonCorrelationFeatureSelector`: A feature selector for removing features with a high Pearson correlation.
       - `InvarianceFeatureSelector`: A feature selector for removing invariant features.
