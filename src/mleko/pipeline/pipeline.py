"""Provides a flexible and customizable Pipeline class for managing and executing a series of data processing steps.

The module defines a Pipeline class that allows for the creation of a sequence of data processing steps. It is
designed for building complex data processing workflows by chaining together custom `PipelineStep` instances.
The Pipeline class encapsulates the ordered sequence of steps added to it and provides methods to manage, execute,
and visualize these steps. Each step's output is passed as input to the next step, effectively managing the flow
of data through the processing pipeline.
