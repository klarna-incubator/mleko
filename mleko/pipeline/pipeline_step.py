"""This module defines the abstract base class for pipeline steps in a data processing pipeline.

The module provides a standard interface for implementing data processing steps as part of a larger pipeline,
via the `PipelineStep` abstract base class. Each `PipelineStep` subclass should have a specific purpose and
