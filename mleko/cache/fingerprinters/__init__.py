"""This package provides Fingerprinter classes for generating unique fingerprints.

Fingerprinters are used for generating unique fingerprints of various data and file types,
such as Vaex DataFrames or CSV files. These fingerprints can be used to track changes in data and support
caching mechanisms.

The following fingerprinting utilities are provided:
    - `BaseFingerprinter`: The base class for all fingerprinters.
    - `CSVFingerprinter`: A fingerprinter for CSV files.
    - `VaexFingerprinter`: A fingerprinter for Vaex DataFrames.
