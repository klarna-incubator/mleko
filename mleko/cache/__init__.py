The core of the caching functionality is provided by the `CacheMixin` class, which can be used to
cache the results of method calls. The `LRUCacheMixin` class can be used to add LRU eviction to the
cache. The `VaexArrowCacheFormatMixin` class can be used to add support for caching Vaex DataFrames
in Arrow format.
