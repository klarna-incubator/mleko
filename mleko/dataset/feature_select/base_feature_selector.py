        The default set of features to be used by the feature selector is all features applicable to the feature
        selector. This can be overridden by passing a list of feature names to the `features` parameter of the
        constructor. The default set of features to be ignored by the feature selector is no features. This can be
        overridden by passing a list of feature names to the `ignore_features` parameter of the constructor.
