        Will drop one of two features that are highly correlated. The feature to be dropped is the one with the lowest
        average correlation with all other features. If both features have the same average correlation, the first
        feature will be dropped. The default set of features is all numeric features in the DataFrame.

        Note:
            Only works with numeric features.

        Warning:
            Make sure to ignore any important features that need to be kept, such as the
            target feature or some identifier.
