## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.8+ and the following tools:

- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/)
- [nox-poetry](https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/)

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ poetry install
```

[poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/
[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/
[nox-poetry]: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

At Klarna, we strive toward achieving the highest possible quality for our products. Therefore, we require you to follow these guidelines if you wish to open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your contribution has to meet the following criteria:

- It is accompanied by a description regarding what has been changed and why.
- Pull requests should implement a boxed change, meaning they should optimally not try to address many things at once.
- All code and documentation must follow the style specified by the included configuration.
- The Nox test suite must pass without errors.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
