## Features

`mleko` is engineered to address the end-to-end needs of machine learning pipelines, providing robust, scalable solutions for data science challenges:

- Ingest: Seamlessly integrates with data sources like AWS S3 and Kaggle, offering hassle-free data ingestion and compatibility.
- Convert: Specializes in data format transformations, prominently featuring high-performance conversions from `CSV` to `Vaex DataFrame`, to make your data pipeline-ready.
- Split: Employs sophisticated data partitioning algorithms, allowing you to segment DataFrames into train, test, and validation sets for effective model training and evaluation.
- Feature Selection: Equipped with a suite of feature selection techniques, `mleko` enables model performance by focusing on the most impactful variables.
- Transformation: Facilitates data manipulations such as Frequency Encoding and Standardization, ensuring that your data conforms to the prerequisites of the machine learning algorithms.
- Model: Provides a core set of functionalities for machine learning models, including in-built support for hyperparameter tuning, thereby streamlining the path from data to deployable model.
- Pipeline: Unifies the entire workflow into an intuitive directed acyclic graph (`DAG`) architecture, promoting reproducibility and reducing iteration time and time-to-market for machine learning models.

By integrating these features, `mleko` serves as a comprehensive toolkit for machine learning practitioners looking to build robust models efficiently.
